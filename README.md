Sleepychat
==========

Because Omegle was just getting annoying.

Built on Node.js and Socket.io, Sleepychat attempts to the problems that plauge the ways we currently use random partner text chat services with hypnosis. Thanks to /u/ZerosHypno, the app is now live! Link: http://protected-cove-8511.herokuapp.com/

Now it just needs... you. Have fun.
